<p>As in every industry, there is a shorthand for the common terminology used within it. This list covers the major terminologu and will be updated as new ones make themselves known:</p>

<ul>
    <li><b>A11y:</b> Short for "Accessibility." It’s a numeronym, meaning there are 11 letters between the "a" and the "y." Ironically, the term itself isn’t very accessible, but here we are!</li>
    <li><b>i18n:</b> Similar concept, but this one stands for "Internationalization." Look. I don't make these up, so don't hassle me.</li>
    <li><b>WCAG:</b> Web Content Accessibility Guidelines. The guidelines we live and die by in accessibility. We’re currently at WCAG 2.2, and the gold standard to meet is Level AA. Though you need to meet Level A fully before you can even say you meet AA. That's just the way it is, folks. WCAG 3 is being worked on, but years away.</li>
    <li><b>W3C:</b> World Wide Web Consortium. The geniuses who gave us WCAG and, ya know, those awesome web standards all the cool kids use.</li>
    <li><b>PwD:</b> People/Person with Disabilities.</li>
    <li><b>ARIA:</b> Accessible Rich Internet Applications. An extension of HTML to make the web more robust and accessible for PwDs. (Also from the W3C—did I mention they’re geniuses?)</li>
    <li><b>AT:</b> Assistive Technology. Various tools used by disabled individuals to navigate the web. For example, a screen reader. (SR is also used interchangeably.)</li>
    <li><b>accName:</b> Short for "Accessible Name." I drop this baby a lot. All interactive components require an accessible name so that AT users understand what they’re interacting with. Example: A button with a magnifying glass icon. You and I know it’s a search button, but does someone who is blind? Adding an accName ensures they will!</li>
    <li><b>ADA:</b> Americans with Disabilities Act. U.S. law protecting people with disabilities from discrimination.</li>
    <li><b>EAA:</b> European Accessibility Act. A new directive from the European Union.</li>
    <li><b>EN 301 549:</b> The EU accessibility standard harmonized with WCAG (often cited with EAA compliance).</li>
    <li><b>Section 508:</b> A requirement for US federal agencies to make their digital content accessible. 508 currently recommends meeting WCAG 2.1 Level AA.</li>
    <li><b>DEIA:</b> Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and Accessibility. These things still matter to a lot of companies.</li>
    <li><b>JAWS:</b> Not the shark—the screen reader. Likely the most widely used in the world.</li>
    <li><b>NVDA:</b> Non-Visual Desktop Access. Another popular screen reader.</li>
    <li><b>VO:</b> Voice Over. A Mac only screen reader.</li>
    <li><b>UX/AX:</b> User Experience/Accessible Experience. I tend to group these so it’s clear we’re talking about an experience that includes everyone—including people with disabilities.</li>
    <li><b>POUR:</b> Used to define the four principles of accessibility. When evaluating an interface, one must always ask if it is <em>Perceivable</em>, <em>Operable</em>, <em>Understabdable</em>, and <em>Robust</em>. WCAG can be organized better under these principles.</li>
    <li><b>VPAT:</b> Voluntary Product Accessibility Template. This templates is used to produce an ACR (sometimes used interchangeably with a VPAT)</li>
    <li><b>ACR:</b> Accessibility Conformance Report. The finsihed report, based on a VPAT. This document can then be used to aid procurement decisions and roadmap initiatives. Many of our clients ask for one.</li>
</ul>
