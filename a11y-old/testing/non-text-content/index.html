1.1.1 Non-text Content, Automated and Manual

Ensure that important images have equivalent alternative text.

Decorative images require an alt attribute, but the value can be left empty, which is also called a “null alt” (alt=””).

CSS backgrounds require no alternative text, but consider using inline image if important.

Linked images must have alternative text. Usually of a functional nature.

Complex image (graphs, infographics) descriptions are provided in context or on a separately linked page .




Question: When are images important? 

Answer: When they are contextually or emotionally important to your content.
