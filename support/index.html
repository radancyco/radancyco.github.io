  <p>At {{ site.company-name }}, we believe that all of your prospective job candidates, regardless of physical, mental or technological capabilities, have a right to learn more about your company and access all job listings. To preserve an individualâ€™s right to universal access, <a href="https://radancy.dev/a11y/baseline/">we attempt to meet</a> as much of <strong>WCAG (Web Content and Accessibility Guidelines) 2.1 Level A and AA</strong> as possible, within our everyday process. However, if there is a need to fully support a specific level of WCAG or other specific guidelines, please bring this to the attention of your account representative as soon as possible.</p>

  <aside id="accessibility-overlay" class="warning">

    <h3>A Note on Accessibility Overlays <a href="#accessibility-overlays"><span aria-hidden="true">#</span><span class="visually-hidden">Anchor</span></a></h3>

    <p>Accessibility overlays are <strong>strongly discouraged</strong> and not in line with Radancy's vision on how best to support people with disabilities in our digital offerings. In our experience, use of these tools may promote ableism, reinforce discrimination and are often perceived, particularly among the disabled and advocacy communities, as a performative commitment to accessibility. Companies using overlays have frequently been subjected to legal actions based on non-compliance with accessibility laws and principles. Upon request, we are happy to share materials addressing the challenges faced by users of overlays.</p>

    <p>If you would like to discuss this issue, along with more proactive, friendly, and sustainable ways to make your careers site accessible to everybody, please reach out to your account representative.</p>

  <h2>Browser Support <a href="#browser-support"><span aria-hidden="true">#</span><span class="visually-hidden">Anchor</span></a></h2>

  <p>{{ site.company-name }} supports the <strong>current</strong> and <strong>prior major</strong> release versions of all major browsers. Corresponding to the date on which your project has launched, we test all work in the following:</p>

Web browser support ends when that browser represents less than 5% of all market share and/or web traffic.</p>

  <p>We do not, as a matter of course, support browsers that are not listed within this document. Should your users or company's browser needs differ, please consult your account representative immediately.</p>

  <h2>Email Support <a href="#email-support"><span aria-hidden="true">#</span><span class="visually-hidden">Anchor</span></a></h2>

  <p>Corresponding to the date on which your project has launched and due to the vast technical differences in email client software, we test all text and HTML based emails in the following primary email client:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Gmail Desktop</strong> (Latest browser versions only)</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Additionally, we test all text and HTML based emails on the following email clients. These may have differences in spacing and sizing of elements that vary from the primary testing email client:</p>

  <ul>
    <li><strong>Outlook</strong> (Latest version of Outlook on Windows 10 only) [Does not support responsive emails]</li>
    <li><strong>iPhone</strong> (Latest version of iOS Mail only) [Not all designs can be built responsively]</li>
    <li><strong>Gmail Android</strong> (Upon Request Only) [Not all designs can be built responsively]</li>
